# Scala-None-Pure-FP-Version
- This is a simple implementation of the elevio article-reviewer app in scala
- It's written in `FP` style but it's not effectful (not using effect system more than just `Either` and `Option`)

## Usage
- `$ sbt compile` # for compiling the sources of the project
- `$ sbt test`    # for running the project's test suite
- `$ sbt run`     # for running the main class of the project
